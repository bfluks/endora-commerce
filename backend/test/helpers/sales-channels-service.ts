/**
 * `SalesChannelsService` over the composed container's own dependencies
 * (issue #251's shape, feature 075's occasion).
 *
 * Two of its arguments are not ones the service can be built without, because
 * production never built it without them. `dictionaryValidator` was optional
 * and always supplied, so the branch tests ran instead was a hand-written
 * `select "code" from "languages" / "currencies"` — a weaker check than the
 * validator's, raising the 422 codes feature 017 superseded, and two other
 * modules' tables named in raw SQL (D-87). `attributionRegistry` is the seam
 * that replaced the second such statement, and the absent form of a delete
 * guard is an open one.
 *
 * Resolving both from the container rather than stubbing them is what makes a
 * service built here the one `backend.ts` builds.
 *
 * `emFactory` stays the caller's, for the reason `promotionServiceFor` states:
 * these suites read back through the manager they wrote with.

 * on the fork. Handing it an `orm` whose `em.fork()` answers the test's
 * transaction-bound manager turns that into a savepoint on the test's
 * connection, so the command sees the uncommitted seed rows, its audit row and
 * write land in the same transaction, and `rollbackTx()` removes all of it.
 * Everything else — actor resolution from the ambient TenantContext (fail
 * closed), the single audit row, the buffered event — is the bus's own code.
