/**
 * `mfa`'s **server-side** off-state, for the surface feature 091's Phase 4
 * batch four moved into its package.
 *
 * `test/integration/mfa/off-state.test.ts` already proves item 6 over this
 * module's routes, its configuration, both presence projections and the D-96
 * login degrade, and none of that changed. What the batch adds is the question
 * that file could not have asked before there was an admin contribution to ask
 * it about: **the palette**. Principle XVII item 5 lists a palette action among
 * the surfaces a switched-off module must not contribute, and the Actions group
 * is resolved *here* — by the server, from the manifests, against the effective
 * enabled-set — so no admin-side test can see it.
 *
 * **`mfa` declared no action until issue #510**, and this file asserted that
 * absence in both states so that whoever added one would be asked for the
 * off-state proof that goes with it. Issue #510 added `open-security`
 * (Principle XVI: an admin could not find the two-factor screen), so the file
 * now asserts the action is advertised while on and withdrawn while off. It
 * carries **no `requiredPermission`**, like the route it opens, so the stub
 * admin session sees it whatever codes it holds.
 *
 * A positive control about a **different** module stays first: an empty answer
 * for `mfa` while off proves nothing until the registry has been seen
 * answering somebody in that same state.
 *
 * `mfa` is the batch's one **switchable** module, so the operator axis —
 * platform-available, activation withdrawn, the case Constitution XVII names —
 * is driven here for real rather than asserted to be inert.
