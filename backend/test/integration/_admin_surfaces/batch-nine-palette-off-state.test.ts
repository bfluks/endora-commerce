/**
 * The **server-side** half of feature 091 batch 9's off-state proof — the
 * command palette, for the two modules that took their admin surfaces into
 * their packages: `assets_library` and `custom_fields`.
 *
 * ## Why this is here and not in the admin
 *
 * The palette's Actions group is resolved by the server, from the manifests,
 * against the effective enabled-set. No admin-side test can see it, which is
 * why every batch of this drain has paired an admin file with a backend one.
 * `admin/test/modules/batch-nine-surfaces.module-owned-surface.test.tsx` is the
 * other half and drives the route and sidebar gates.
 *
 * ## What each module brings to it
 *
 * `custom_fields` already declared `open-custom-fields`, so what the drain adds
 * for it is the proof that the advertisement goes when the module does — and
 * the pairing below, which nothing else in the estate makes:
 * `check:action-route-permissions` holds a declared `requiredPermission` to the
 * code enforced on its own `targetRoute`, and what it cannot see is that the
 * route is one the **admin** declares, because it reconstructs an API path.
 * Since this batch that route is a line in the module's own `./admin` layer, so
 * the two declarations are read from the two artefacts and compared here rather
 * than copied into a table.
 *
 * `assets_library` declared none when this batch landed, and paid that
 * Principle XVI entry later (`specs/156-asset-stable-url/`): it now declares
 * `open-assets-library` ("Assets library", `assets.read`), so it is held to the
 * same two proofs — the advertisement goes when the module does, and the
 * declared permission is the one its own `./admin` route enforces. The table
 * below names its action ids, so adding or dropping one without updating it
 * fails here.
 *
 * ## The axis is chosen from the manifest, not guessed
 *
 * **Both** modules declare `activation.nonDeactivatable`, so a seeded
 * deactivation leaves either **present** and every assertion under it would be
 * measuring the module switched on — issue #141's shape. The platform axis is
 * what a locked module still has, and a deployment that never installs it
 * reaches the same gate. The lock is read off the manifest in the last case
 * below rather than restated here.
