/**
 * Sealed pagination cursors (issue #497).
 *
 * `encodeCursor` (`../http/cursor.ts`) is base64 of a key, and every listing
 * that pages by a keyset of what its client already sees is right to use it.
 * A listing whose next position can be a row its client must not learn about —
 * the catalogue's price-ordered walk, whose scan budget can stop it on a product
 * the viewer may not see or whose price is withheld, with that product's amount
 * and id in the keyset — seals its cursor instead: the client gets a token it
 * can hand back and cannot read or forge.
 *
 * AES-256-GCM from `node:crypto`, no new dependency (Principle IV). The key is
 * derived with HKDF from the secret the host passes — the session key, which a
 * production instance refuses to start without — so there is no new input for an
 * operator to provision, and the derived key is used for nothing else. Rotating
 * the session key therefore also makes cursors in flight unreadable, and a
 * listing answers an unreadable cursor as one it cannot parse.
 *
 * The token is `base64url(version ‖ iv ‖ tag ‖ ciphertext)`. The purpose is the
 * GCM additional data, so a cursor sealed by one listing opens in no other. The
 * plaintext is padded to a multiple of {@link PAD_BLOCK} bytes (ISO/IEC 7816-4:
 * `0x80`, then zeros), so a token's length does not follow the number of digits
 * in an amount it carries.
 *
 * **Deterministic, on purpose.** The IV is synthetic — an HMAC of the purpose
 * and the payload under a second derived key — so one position always seals to
 * one token. A storefront renders a cursor into a link: with a random IV every
 * render of the same page would name its next page by a new URL, which a cache
 * cannot reuse and a crawler would follow without end (Principle VII). What
 * determinism discloses is that two cursors name the same position, which a
 * client reading the two pages they lead to already knows. The IV still never
 * repeats across two different plaintexts short of an HMAC collision, which is
 * the condition GCM needs.
