/**
 * SalesChannelsService — feature 005 / T017 (skeleton) + T035-T037 (US2).
 *
 * Admin-side CRUD + lifecycle for the Sales Channel registry. Membership
 * mutations live in {@link SalesChannelMembershipService}; this service
 * deals exclusively with the channel row's identity, lifecycle, and
 * the FR-002 / FR-006 / FR-007 guards.
 *
 * Optimistic concurrency uses the `version` column. Update calls take
 * an `expectedVersion` argument; mismatch raises HTTP 412
 * `STALE_SALES_CHANNEL_WRITE` with the current version in the body so
 * the client can refresh and retry. This matches feature 003 / 004's
 * pattern.
 *
 * Every successful identity / lifecycle change writes one audit row
 * (`sales_channel.identity.changed` / `sales_channel.lifecycle.changed`),
 * **drops the channel cache**, and then emits one EventBus event. Identity
 * writes (create, update) are Commands — `commands/identity.command.ts` — so
 * their row is the Command Bus's, written in the write's own transaction with
 * the actor from the ambient TenantContext; lifecycle writes are still audited
 * by hand here.
 *
 * That order is the whole of D-93 (issue #160). The drop used to be a
 * subscriber — `attachSalesChannelsCacheInvalidator` listened for those two
 * events — which made cache freshness a property of the dispatch order rather
 * than of the write: `dictionaries` subscribes to the same two names and its
 * Redis SCAN has already been measured pushing the invalidator past a tick
 * (#101), and an emission inside an `EventBus.run` scope is buffered until the
 * scope ends, so a write and a read-back in one Command could not be helped by
 * any registration order at all. The events stay — other modules want them —
 * and they stop being how this cache learns about this service's own write.
 *
 * `setDefault` is a Command too (feature 072 / D-51): the Command Bus writes its
 * audit row and buffers its event co-transactionally. The identity Commands
 * declare no event, so the drop-then-announce order above holds for them: the
 * service drops the cache once `CommandBus.run` has committed, then emits.
