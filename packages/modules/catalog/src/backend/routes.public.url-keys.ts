/**
 * Feature 163 (`specs/163-product-data-scopes/contracts/url-keys-and-redirects.md`
 * §4) — `GET /api/v1/catalog/products/resolve/:key`: which product a storefront
 * key names at the request's (channel, language), or where it redirects.
 *
 * The channel is the one the canonical middleware resolved (Constitution XII) and
 * the audience comes from the session (`productAudienceOf`), never from the
 * client; both reach this route through the catalogue's own request context
 * reader. The answer depends on the audience — an unavailable product is not
 * found, for a redirect too — so a signed-in caller's answer is stamped
 * `private, no-store`.
 *
 * A redirect is answered as `200` with `kind: 'redirect'` rather than a `301`: the
 * storefront's server fetch would follow a `301` silently and render the target
 * under the old URL (research R12).
