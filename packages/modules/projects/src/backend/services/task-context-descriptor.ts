/**
 * The `project` Task context (research R-1, R-9): what makes a Task belong to
 * a Project and one of its Stages, without `tasks` knowing Projects exist.
 *
 * Every answer runs under the **caller's** ambient context and goes through
 * `ProjectAccess` — the Organization rule and the visibility rule (R-2, R-3) —
 * so a Project Task is seen exactly by whoever may see its Project: in the
 * Tasks list, in *My Tasks*, by id, and nowhere else. With Projects switched
 * off the registry stops enumerating this descriptor and the Tasks are hidden
 * (fail-closed); they return when Projects is back.
 *
 * `canSeeAs` answers for somebody else — the assignee the Tasks module is
 * about to tell — through `ProjectAccess.canSeeAs` (research R-4), so the bell
 * never names a Task of a Project its recipient may not see.
 *
 * `canChangeTasks` lets a Task into a Project, out of one — detached, or moved
 * to another record — or deleted from one only for a caller holding
 * `projects:write` who sees the Project (T144, T147).
 *
 * `describe` names a Project by number and title, links to its screen, and
 * labels each Stage — the Task's group — by its current name. It describes only
 * the Projects `visibleIds` hands back; an id it leaves out is shown by
 * `tasks` as an unavailable record.
 *
 * `renderNote` words the note a Stage Task leaves on a Task nobody was
 * assigned to: it is **stored as the Role** (`role:<id>`, {@link responsibleRoleNote}),
 * never as a sentence, so each reader sees it in their own language with the
 * Role's current name. Any other note is shown as stored.
 *
 * `existingContexts` tells the Tasks module's maintenance pass which Projects
 * still exist and which Stages each has, whoever may see them
 * (`specs/165-task-management/` R-19, issue #450): the Tasks of a Project
 * deleted while Tasks was off are then deleted, and those of a deleted Stage
 * lose it. Asked only in the system scope, answered by
 * `ProjectAccess.existingWithStages`. With Projects off it is never asked — the
 * registry does not enumerate this descriptor — so nothing is taken for gone.
