/**
 * Customer-side auth flows (T119; two-step login added in feature 042).
 *
 * - login: email + password → first factor. When an `MfaLoginPort` is injected
 *   and the account has active 2FA (or 2FA is enforced for the scope), login
 *   returns an `mfaRequired` / `mfaSetupRequired` outcome WITHOUT a session;
 *   the second step is completed by the MFA module's verify endpoint. When no
 *   port is present (or it returns `proceed`), login issues the session exactly
 *   as before (password-only fallback, FR-033).
 * - logout: destroy session.
 * - changePassword: argon2 verify of `currentPassword`; reject with
 *   401 CURRENT_PASSWORD_INVALID otherwise; rehash + persist, then end every
 *   other session of the account, retire its outstanding reset tokens and
 *   withdraw the logins it had begun.
 *
 * Feature 075, Phase C — the three things this service needed from `auth` are
 * now named where they belong rather than in `auth`'s directory. Sessions come
 * over {@link AuthSessionPort}, so a session is minted or destroyed through the
 * surface `auth` publishes and never through its `Session` entity. The MFA seam
 * is `auth`'s *shape* implemented by `mfa`, published in `@endora-commerce/contracts` so
 * this service depends on neither module for it. And the password hash is a
 * pure function that moved to `src/kernel/crypto/`: an operator switching a
 * module off must not make "hash this string" answer 503.
