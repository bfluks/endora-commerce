/**
 * The records of the three operator-switchable owners a Task refers to
 * (`specs/165-task-management/` research R-5, R-16) — the **one door** to
 * `quote_requests`, `crm` and `projects`, so that every caller decides an
 * owner's **presence first**.
 *
 * This module only *degrades* without each of them (the manifest's
 * `degrades-without` edges): a referenced record of an absent owner renders as
 * unavailable and the `@@` list offers none. Nothing here, and nothing that
 * calls this, catches a closed gate as a signal — ask
 * {@link TaskRecordOwners.isPresent} before anything else.
 *
 * Every read runs under the caller's tenant scope, as the owners' ports do; a
 * Project the caller may not see is not returned by its port either. Which
 * caller may read which kind at all is `owner-read-permissions.ts`'.
 *
 * A function rather than an object literal at the composition site:
 * `check:port-catches` follows the ports through the value.
