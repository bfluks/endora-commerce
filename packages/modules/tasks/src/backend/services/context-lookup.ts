 * caller may see **and may put a Task into** (`canChangeTasks`), whose label
 * holds `q`, by label, at most {@link CONTEXT_LOOKUP_LIMIT}, each with its
 * groups (a Project's Stages) in the owner's order.
 *
 * `tasks` names no owner: each is asked through the descriptor it registered,
 * and an owner that is off is not asked at all (the registry's fail-closed
 * enumeration). The descriptor publishes no search, so the label is matched
 * here over what `describe` answers for the contexts the caller may see.
