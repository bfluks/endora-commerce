/**
 * The comments of a Task (`specs/165-task-management/` User Story 4, FR-025,
 * FR-026, research R-6; `contracts/admin-api.md` §2) — Projects'
 * `comment-service.ts`, the model, with notes only.
 *
 * - **Anybody who may see the Task may comment on it** (`tasks:read` on the
 *   route); a Task they may not see is 404 as one that does not exist, and
 *   someone else's private Task — read by a holder of `tasks:see_private` — is
 *   read only (`TaskAccess.assertMayChange`, 403 `TASK_PRIVATE_READ_ONLY`).
 * - **A comment is its author's.** Only the author edits or deletes it —
 *   holding every permission there is does not make somebody else's comment
 *   theirs (403). A deleted comment keeps its place in the thread, emptied and
 *   marked, and is changed no more.
 * - **Its references** are the comment's own rows of `task_references`
 *   (`source_kind = 'comment'`, `source_id` the comment), replaced inside the
 *   Command that saves the text and removed with it; on read they are resolved
 *   per reader, one call per kind for the whole thread.
 * - **Who is told, after the commit:** somebody a save newly mentions gets the
 *   mention (`mention-service.ts`); a new comment also tells every assignee and
 *   the Creator, except its author and except whoever was just told of the
 *   mention — nobody gets both for one comment (R-6). Every recipient must
 *   still be able to see the Task ({@link TaskAudience}); an edit tells only
 *   the newly mentioned.
 *
 * Every read starts from `TaskAccess.loadVisible` and is keyed by that Task's
 * id. Every write is a Command recorded against the Task — **without the
 * text**: the audit trail is not tenant-scoped, so it says that a comment was
 * written, by whom and how long it was.
