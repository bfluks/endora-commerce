/**
 * The maintenance pass — Tasks never stay orphaned (`specs/165-task-management/`
 * research R-19, FR-040, SC-006; issue #450).
 *
 * A context's owner deletes its record's Tasks through `taskWritePort` only
 * while Tasks is on; a Project deleted while Tasks was off keeps its Tasks,
 * hidden for good, and a Stage deleted then keeps its Tasks in a group no
 * screen shows. This pass, the third of the `tasks-reminders` tick, at most
 * every fifteen minutes, asks each owner which of its contexts still exist:
 *
 * - the Tasks of a context that is gone are deleted, one `tasks.task.delete`
 *   Command each, as the system, `reason: 'context_gone'` — their sub-tasks
 *   become top-level as on any deletion, and `tasks.task.deleted.v1` goes out;
 * - the Tasks of a group that is gone lose it, one `tasks.task.update` each,
 *   `reason: 'context_group_gone'`.
 *
 * **Only present owners that implement `existingContexts` are asked.**
 * `registry.present()` leaves out an owner that is off, so a Project whose
 * module is off is never taken for deleted (FR-040), and an owner without the
 * method is never cleaned. The owner's answer is **regardless of who may see**
 * — which is why the pass runs only in the system scope its worker enters, and
 * the owner refuses anybody else.
 *
 * Contexts are walked by id, {@link MAINTENANCE_BATCH} distinct ids of one type
 * at a time, so a pass's memory does not grow with the table. Every write
 * re-reads its Task under the lock and leaves one that moved meanwhile.
 *
 * Reads of `tasks` here are the platform-wide sweep's own: it learns ids, never
 * hands a Task to anybody, and writes only through the Task Commands.
