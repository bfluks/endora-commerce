/**
 * The clock for Task reminders and the daily digest (`specs/165-task-management/`
 * research R-17, R-18, `contracts/ports-and-events.md` §8; Constitution X).
 * Projects' `stage-alert-worker.ts` and CRM's `event-reminder-worker.ts` are
 * the model.
 *
 * **BullMQ is the clock and nothing more.** One module-wide Job Scheduler fires
 * every sixty seconds and its job carries no data: what is due is read from
 * the tables on every tick, so a flushed Redis loses a tick and never a
 * reminder, and a moved due date has no queue to keep in step. A reminder goes
 * out within a minute or two of its moment (SC-004).
 *
 * **One tick, up to three passes.** The reminders on every tick; the digest
 * and the maintenance pass (`#450`, User Story 10 — Tasks whose context's
 * record is gone) each when fifteen minutes have passed since its last run in
 * this process — an in-memory stamp per pass, so a restart only makes it run
 * sooner, and a clock that went back runs it at once.
 *
 * **More than one consumer is fine.** A reminder is claimed per recipient by
 * its delivery row, a digest per person and day by its subscription row, so
 * two worker processes ticking at once tell each person once.
