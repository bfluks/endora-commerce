A buyer's quote line is judged at the request's scope language, as a basket line is. `CreateForCustomerOptions` gains `languageTag` — the request's first `Accept-Language` tag, resolved against the channel's own languages — and `RfqService.createForCustomer`, `patchDraft` and `resubmit` ask `catalogProductAvailabilityPort` and snapshot line and unit names at it; absent, at the channel's default language. `language` is now a message language only: it used to decide the scope too, so a buyer asking in a language the message bundles do not carry (`de-DE` answered in Polish) was quoted a product switched off in that language. The customer quote routes, the basket's conversion to a quote request (`CartConversionService.convertToQuoteRequest`'s options gain `languageTag`) and the buyer's quick-order build to a quote request (`QuickOrderBuildOptions.languageTag`) pass the tag.
