`cms.Video` plays a self-hosted file, `cms.Image` gains art direction, an aspect ratio per breakpoint, an overlay and a caption, and images in rich text take a size, an alignment and an inline mode. Every existing option keeps its meaning, and content saved before renders as it did.

**`cms.Video`.** A new `source` (`embed`, today's, or `file`) adds a self-hosted video: `videoAssetId` (or a direct file URL in `url`), an optional `mobileVideoAssetId` shown below the tablet width, and a `posterAssetId`. A file loads nothing until it plays (`preload="none"`), plays inline, and never carries the `autoplay` attribute; with `autoplay` it is muted and started only while on screen, never for a visitor who prefers reduced motion. `aspectRatio` keeps `16:9`, `4:3` and `1:1` and now takes every aspect token and a custom `w:h`, per breakpoint, on the editor's Responsive tab. A stored video with no `source` is an embed.

**`cms.Image`.** New optional props: `mobileSrc` / `mobileAssetId` (a `<picture>` source below the tablet width), `ratio` (per breakpoint; the frame reserves the space), `overlay` (`none`, `solid` or `gradient`, with direction and strength), and `caption` with `captionPlacement` (`below` or `beside`). `caption` is translatable. The image is now lazy-loaded and decoded asynchronously; with none of the new props set its markup and look are otherwise unchanged.

**Video frames.** The hero's video above the content and the `cms.MediaText` video take `media.ratio` per breakpoint; unset is the 16:9 frame they had.

**Rich-text images.** The TipTap `image` node gains `size` (a width in px or %) and `align` (`left`, `center`, `right`), rendered as `class="cmsc-rich-img cmsc-rich-img--<align>"` and `style="width: …"`; a new inline node `inlineImage` sets an image in the line of text. The editor's image dialog inserts and edits both. The sanitiser keeps a `width` in px or % on an `<img>` only; its policy's `cleanStyle` receives the element name as an optional second argument. New exports from `@endora-commerce/cms-components`: `richImageNode`, `inlineImageNode`, `RICH_IMAGE_SIZE_RE`, `RICH_IMAGE_ALIGNS`, `ImageDialog`, `RichImageChoice`; `overlayStyle` is exported from the section frame.

**Fields.** `@endora-commerce/page-builder-core` exports `createAspectRatioField` (a responsive aspect-ratio field: a preset or a custom `w:h`, per breakpoint) and three field-text keys (`ratio.auto`, `ratio.custom`, `ratio.customValue`, translated in `mod-i18n`). `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` exports `ResponsiveRatioControl`, the image field's per-breakpoint ratio control, for ratios nested in a composite value. In the CMS editor the video's files and poster, and the image's mobile image, are picked from the asset library; every field of `cms.Video` and `cms.Image` is labelled in English and Polish.
