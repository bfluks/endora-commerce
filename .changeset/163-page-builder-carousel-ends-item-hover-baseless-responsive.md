Carousels can stop at their ends instead of wrapping around, carousel image captions and link tile texts can change colour on hover, and a responsive value saved without a mobile value now applies from the breakpoint that has one.

Nothing changes for a block that does not use the new options: no option is in any `defaultProps`, and the default markup and look are the ones the blocks had.

- **Carousel ends.** `loop` (`boolean`) on the Carousel, `catalog.ProductSlider` and `blog.LatestPosts`, hidden for a grid. Unset or `true` keeps today's wrap-around: the previous arrow on the first page goes to the last page, and the next arrow on the last page back to the first. With `false`, `CarouselShell` stops at the first and last page. The arrow at an end gets the native `disabled` attribute and keeps its name, so a screen reader announces it as unavailable. On the first page the previous arrow is already disabled in the server HTML. The arrows follow the scroll position. An arrow disabled while it has focus passes the focus to the other arrow. Autoplay stops on the last page.
- **Disabled arrow look.** `controls.disabledArrowLook` (`'dim' | 'outline-light' | 'color'`) and `controls.disabledArrowColor` (a brand colour token or a hex value). `dim` is the default (`opacity: 0.4`). The other two looks set the root class `cmsc-pb-carousel--arrow-off-light` or `--arrow-off-color` (with `--pb-arrow-off-color`), and only a carousel that does not loop gets one.
- **Hover colours.** `cms.CarouselImage.captionHoverColor` and `cms.LinkTile.titleHoverColor` / `labelHoverColor` take a brand colour token or a hex value. The colour applies on hover and on keyboard focus, with a 0.2 s colour transition, or none under reduced motion. Only an item given a colour gets the class (`cmsc-pb-carousel-image--hover-caption`, `cmsc-pb-link-tile--hover-title`, `--hover-label`) and the custom property.
- **Responsive values without `base`.** `isResponsiveProp` now also accepts an object that holds only `tablet` and/or `desktop`. `normalizeResponsive` gives such a value the caller's fallback as its base, so the breakpoints below the first one with a value render as unset. Before, the whole value was read as unset. The editor's scoped field readers, `ResponsiveRatioControl` and the hand-rolled readers in `cms.Button`, block alignment and `cms.FeatureList` read it the same way. An object with any other key is still a plain value.

The `cms`, `catalog` and `blog` bundles carry the English and Polish field labels.
