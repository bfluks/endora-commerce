A rich-text "read more" can place its summary and open upwards, an accordion gains look options, both open and close with an animation, and a highlighted phrase can take any brand colour or hex.

Nothing changes for content that does not use them: the default markup and look are the ones the blocks had.

- **Read more position and reveal above.** The rich-text `readMore` node gains `chevronPosition` (`'start' | 'center' | 'end'`, `'start'` by default) and `revealAbove` (`false` by default). They add `cmsc-read-more--center` / `--end` and `cmsc-read-more--reveal-above` to the `<details>`, the same through the DOM-free serializer and TipTap's, and are parsed back from them. The sanitiser is unchanged. Reveal above shows the open passage's content above its summary through CSS order only: the summary stays the first child and the one control. The rich-text toolbar gains **Read more position** and **Show the revealed text above the summary**.
- **Animated open and close.** A read-more passage animates its `::details-content` height and an accordion panel its height and opacity, only without reduced motion and only where the browser supports `interpolate-size` (instant elsewhere). An accordion animates only after hydration (`data-animate`), so a panel open by default does not animate on page load. Every accordion panel stays in the server HTML, `hidden` while closed.
- **Accordion look.** `cms.Accordion` gains `icon` (`'plus' | 'chevron'`), `itemStyle` (`'plain' | 'boxed'`), `dividers` (`'none' | 'between' | 'all'`, for plain items) and `titlePadding` / `titlePaddingPx` (a spacing token or Custom px per breakpoint, on the Responsive tab). Each is unset by default and writes nothing then.
- **Emphasis colour.** The inline rich-text `emphasis` mark accepts an optional `color` (`#rrggbb` or `token:<role>`, `null` as unset) in `inlineRichTextSchema`. It renders `data-cms-em-color` and an inline `color` on the variant's span, in `InlineRich` and through both TipTap serializers. A colour outside that grammar renders today's span. The rich-text sanitiser keeps `data-cms-em-color` on a `<span>` with a colour value only. The inline toolbar gains **Highlight colour** (brand colours, a hex, **Remove colour**). The translation codec carries the mark unchanged.
- **Labels.** The new toolbar and dialog labels are page-builder field text (`pageBuilder.fieldText.emphasisColor.*`, `pageBuilder.fieldText.readMore.*`), and the accordion fields are labelled in English and Polish.
